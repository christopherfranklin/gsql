# GSQL

This is a simple clone of (SQLite)[https://www.sqlite.org/index.html] written in Go. The purpose of this project is not to replace SQLite. Instead, it is meant to be a learning opportunity to better understand both Relational Databases and the Go Programming Language.

This project is not meant to be used in production settings!
